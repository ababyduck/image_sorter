# image_sorter
A quick and simple Python script for sorting images (such as wallpaper) by their aspect ratio.  Takes a folder of images and sorts them by aspect ratio.  Multi-monitor aspect ratios are detected, and it is possible to configure:
- Which aspect ratios are accepted (everything else is thrown into a "Weird" folder)
- Minimum dimensions
